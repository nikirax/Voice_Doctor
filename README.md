This app was created for a college project. I was the only one working on the code. If you want to see it, then the installation instructions will follow. 

### How install this app

In order to install the application, download `.zip` or `clone this repository`. Then you need the file `requirements.txt` it contains all the necessary libraries to run. 

`!!Attention to install this application you must have python and pip installed!!`

Next, we write the command (it can be installed into a virtual space or use the one that is there, although it is only for UNIX OS systems):

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt 
```
or
```bash
pip3 install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
Next, go to the application folder in the terminal (console) and write the command:

```bash
python main.py 
```
or
```bash
python3 main.py
```
## Done thanks for reading!
